Privacy Policy — Fortune First AI Insurance Copilot

1. Introduction
Fortune First provides an educational AI Copilot for insurance planning. We prioritize privacy and security.

2. Information Collected
We collect voluntary, non-sensitive inputs (age range, household structure, goals) and anonymized interaction metadata (session length, features used). We do not request or store SSNs, medical records, or bank login credentials.

3. Use of Information
Inputs are used to generate real-time educational responses and anonymized analytics for product improvement and pilot reporting.

4. Storage & Security
Data in transit is encrypted (HTTPS). By default, PII is not persisted. Logs used for analysis are anonymized and access-controlled.

5. Third-Party Providers
We may use trusted AI providers (such as OpenAI) under their security terms. Sensitive identifiers are not sent to third parties.

6. Consent
Users must consent before using the Copilot. Consent is recorded for session validation only.

7. Rights
Users can request data deletion and opt out of analytics where applicable.
